# Data Sources and Constraints (Draft)

## EUIPO API Portal
- Products in scope: Trademark Search API, Goods & Services (TMclass), EUTM Filing API (optional).
- Rate limits are enforced per product and plan.
- Production access requires approval and identity/business verification.
- Conditions of use forbid circumvention of rate limits and allow EUIPO to review API clients for compliance.
- EUTM filing requires clear warnings and explicit user confirmation before filing; additional safeguards apply for e-commerce flows.

## WIPO Global Brand Database
- Valuable for cross-border visibility, but the terms restrict automated queries and bulk extraction.
- Use as a reference/redirect unless separate permission is granted.

## UKIPO
- Open data trademark snapshot available on data.gov.uk (last update noted in 2018).
- Useful for historical insights; not suitable for live monitoring without newer feeds.

## USPTO (United States)
- USPTO Open Data Portal provides access to datasets and APIs for trademark data.

## TMview
- EUIPO-led multi-jurisdiction search tool that aggregates many offices.
- Consider for coverage benchmarking; verify data reuse permissions for API or bulk access.

## Notes
- Always confirm licensing, attribution, and data reuse rules before caching or republishing.
- Keep a clear legal disclaimer and data freshness indicators in UI.
